Currently a data scientist at [tonic.ai](https://tonic.ai). Formerly a mathematician. I have PhD in math from UC Santa Cruz and did my undergrad at UC Berkeley. I wrote a bunch of posts on this blog in 2020 when I was making the transition from academia to industry and was a machine learning novice. The posts were about projects I did to improve my data science and programming skills. Currently (2023), I'm using the blog to write short fun posts to write some things that I know and think are interesting. I have some technical expertise in synthetic data, neural networks, machine learning, large language models and the like from my job, but I don't write much about that stuff here. The blog is more for fun random things that are maybe tangentially related to what I do at work.
