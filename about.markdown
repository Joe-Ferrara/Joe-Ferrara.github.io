Currently a data scientist at [tonic.ai](https://tonic.ai) working on models for generating synthetic data. Formerly a mathematicion. I have PhD in math from UC Santa Cruz and did my undergrad at UC Berkeley. I am interested in mathematics and programming in general, and more specifically number theory and machine learning.

The purpose of this website is to post write ups for projects I've done. The posts can be technical at times. I hope the technical parts are readable for people with some math and/or computer science background and interest.
