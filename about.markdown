I am currently a postdoc at UC San Diego in the mathematics department. I received my PhD from UC Santa Cruz and did my undergrad at UC Berkeley. I am interested in mathematics and programming in general, and more specifically number theory and machine learning.

The purpose of this blog is to post write ups for projects I've done recently. The posts are generally technically but I hope they are readable to people some math and or computer science background and interest.
