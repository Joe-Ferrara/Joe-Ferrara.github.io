I am currently a postdoc at UC San Diego in the mathematics department. I received my PhD from UC Santa Cruz and did my undergrad at UC Berkeley. I am interested in mathematics and programming in general, and more specifically number theory and machine learning.

The purpose of this website/blog is to post write ups for projects, and to have math posts that are accessible (hopefully) to people without a PhD in math but with some math background and interest.
