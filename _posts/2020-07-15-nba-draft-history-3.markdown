In this post, I use my [NBA draft history](https://github.com/Joe-Ferrara/nba-draft-history) data to do a historical analysis of the best colleges at producing NBA players. The two criteria I use are total number of players drafted since 1967, and total [Agg](https://joe-ferrara.github.io/2020/06/28/nba-draft-history-1.html) of all players drafted over a 5 year period. The six colleges with the most players drafted since 1967 have their picks per year and total picks since 1967 graphed and analyzed. The top ten total Agg scores for nonoverlapping five year periods are recorded with the players drafted, and commented on.

## Most Draft Picks

Since 1967, the six colleges with the most NBA draft picks are UCLA, Kentucky, Duke, North Carolina (UNC), Kansas, and Arizona. The following list has these colleges' pick counts. Clicking on the college sends you to a bar graph of number of picks that college had each year since 1967 and some commentary on the best five year periods of picks for that college.

**Colleges producing the most draft picks since 1967**:
* [UCLA](#UCLA): 73
* [Kentucky](#Kentucky): 73
* [Duke](#Duke): 65
* [UNC](#UNC): 64
* [Kansas](#Kansas): 53
* [Arizona](#Arizona): 48

For each of these colleges, their total picks over time are graphed below:

![image](/pictures/nba_draft_history_3/total_picks_since_1967.png "Total Picks Since 1967")

As seen in the graph, UCLA dominated during the 70s, 80s, and 90s with North Carolina in second most of the time. Around 2010, Duke and Kentucky had sharp spikes catching up to UCLA and North Carolina by 2019 respectively.

To get a better modern picture of these colleges' draft history, I split the time period 1967 - 2019 at the year 1995 and considered drafts before 1995 and from 1995 onward. I chose the year 1995 because that is the year when Kevin Garnett was drafted, the first player drafted out of high school since Moses Malone was drafted to the ABA out of high school in 1974. From 1995 to 2006, many players went strait from high school to the NBA (these players included Kobe Bryant and Lebron James) affecting how draft prospects were considered, and how long college players stayed in school.

The colleges that contributed the most draft picks from 1967 through 1994 are UCLA, North Carolina (UNC), Indiana, Louisville, Michigan, NC State, and Kentucky. Their pick numbers and a graph of their picks over time follows.

**Colleges producing the most draft picks from 1967 to 1994**:
* **UCLA**: 36 (National Champs: 1967, 1968, 1969, 1970, 1971, 1972, 1973, 1975)
* **UNC**: 29 (National Champs: 1982, 1993)
* **Indiana**: 26 (National Champs: 1976, 1981, 1987)
* **Louisville**: 26 (National Champs: 1980, 1986)
* **Michigan**: 24 (National Champs: 1989)
* **NC State**: 22 (National Champs: 1974, 1983)
* **Kentucky**: 22 (National Champs: 1978)

![image](/pictures/nba_draft_history_3/total_picks_1967_to_1994.png "Total Picks From 1967 to 1994")

During this time period, we see clear dominance by UCLA, which was a historically dominant team winning 8 National Championships. Indiana, Louisville, Michigan, and NC State appear in this list after not appearing in the 1967 - 2019 list, and they all had success during this time period with Indiana winning 3 National Championships, Louisville 2, Michigan 1, and NC State 2.

The colleges with the most draft picks from 1995 through 2019 are Kentucky, Duke, UCLA, North Carolina (UNC), Kansas, and Arizona. The same colleges in the original list. The number picks for these colleges over this time period follows:

**Colleges producing the most draft picks from 1995 to 2019**:
* **Kentucky**: 51 (National Champs: 1996, 1998, 2012)
* **Duke**: 44 (National Champs: 2001, 2010, 2015)
* **UCLA**: 37 (National Champs: 1995)
* **UNC**: 35 (National Champs: 2005, 2009, 2017)
* **Kansas**: 34 (National Champs: 2008)
* **Arizona**: 32 (National Champs: 1997)

Here is a graph of these colleges' total picks of the time period of 1995 to 2019.

![image](/pictures/nba_draft_history_3/total_picks_1995_to_2019.png "Total Picks From 1995 to 2019")

High school players were allowed in the draft from 1995 through 2005, with the 2006 draft being the first one where high school players were not allowed to be drafted. On the graph, there is a spike is slope for Kansas in 2008, Kentucky in 2010, and Duke in 2011, as these colleges most aggressively took advantage of high school players not being able to enter the NBA draft after 2005. The post 2005 era in college basketball has become known as the one and done era, as the top college prospects more often than not only stay in college for one year, after which they become eligible to join the NBA.

## Best Draft Periods

In addition to considering the colleges that produced the most NBA draft picks, I also considered the colleges that produced the best NBA draft picks. To do this, I considered any five year period for any college starting with the period 1967 - 1971, and ending with the period 2009 - 2013, as 2013 is the last year I have Agg scores for draft picks. For each five year period, I added up the Agg scores for all the players drafted from each college.

Below is a list of the top ten five year periods of draft picks for any college, along with the sum of the Agg score of the draft picks over that period. Clicking an item in the list will send you to a table of the players drafted during the period, their respective Agg scores, and some words about the success of the college during the period. The list was created so that multiple overlapping time periods from the same college do not appear. If overlapping time periods for a college would have appeared in this list, then the lower scored time periods were removed and only the highest scored time period appears. The lower scored overlapping time periods are noted below  in the section where the highest scored time period is discussed.

**Coach**: John Calipari (2009 - present)

John Calipari's name at Kentucky is ubiquitous with the one and done era. During recruiting, Calipari promises players that he will do the best job getting them ready for and to the NBA, and he has a track record of success. Calipari's Kentucky teams would have even higher Agg scores if the Agg statistic was calculated for drafts after 2013. During the given time period Kentucky had great success in the NCAA tournament, winning a National Championship in 2012 and making it to the Final Four in 2011.

Overlapping Notable Periods:
* 2008 - 2012, total Agg 45.21

**Coach**: Roy Williams (2003 - present)

Roy Williams wouldn't win his first National Championship until 2016. These teams are good examples of great teams put together by Williams that could not quite win it all. North Carolina made it to the Final Four in 2009 and 2008 (with Danny Green, Ty Lawson, Tyler Hansbrough, and Wayne Ellington from this list on the team), but somehow did not make it to a National Championship game during this time period.

**Coaches** Dean Smith (1961 - 1997) and Bill Guthridge (1998 - 2000)

Coming off a National Championship in 1993 (with Eric Montross as the only player on this list on that team), North Carolina made it to the Final Four in 1995, 1997, and 1998, though they never made it to the National Championship game. This was the tail end of Dean Smith's illustrious career at North Carolina, after which his longtime assistant Bill Guthridge became the head coach for 3 successful seasons (North Carolina also made it to the Final Four in 2000).

**Coach** Dean Smith (1961 - 1997)

During this period, North Carolina had the most famous (and arguably best) basketball player ever in Michael Jordan. This was during the middle of Dean Smith's great tenure as head coach of North Carolina. This team made it to the National Championship in 1981 and 1982, winning it in 1982 on a shot by Michael Jordan.

Kansas did not crack the top 10 for best draft picks drafted over a 5 year period, but the college has an illustrious men's basketball history. They have had three successive great coaches in Larry Brown (1983 - 1988), Roy Williams (1989 - 2003), and Bill Self (2004 - present), winning the National Championship under Brown in 1988 and Self in 2008.

This era at Texas produced a lot of good (and one great) NBA players, though did not produce a ton of success in the NCAA Tournament. While I haven't listed any team's Elite Eight appearances (I have stuck to Final Four and National Championship appearances), these Texas teams never made it to the Final Four. The best they did was the Elite Eight in 2006 and 2008.
